# About Verena

🦠 We're an NSF-funded collaboration working to predict viral emergence. 

🕸️ Our research often uses network science and machine learning to analyze and predict complex systems, especially host-virus networks.

📝 All of our [publications](https://www.viralemergence.org/work) are all available for download as PDFs (even if they're paywalled elsewhere).

💻 Read more on our [website](viralemergence.org).

### On our Github...

👩‍💻 Code for several ongoing and published projects is available here.

🔢 You can also access [datasets](https://www.viralemergence.org/data), like 
- the [VIRION](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/virion) database of host-virus interactions 
- [CLOVER](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/clover), the hand-curated backbone of VIRION (which includes non-viral pathogens) 
- the [insectDisease](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/insectDisease) R interface to the Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens.
