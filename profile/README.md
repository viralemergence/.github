🦠 We're an NSF-funded data-driven collaboration working to predict viral emergence.

👩‍💻 Code for several ongoing and [published](https://www.viralemergence.org/work) projects is available here.

🔢 You can also access [data](https://www.viralemergence.org/data) and software packages, like 
- the [VIRION](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/virion) database of host-virus interactions 
- [CLOVER](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/clover), the hand-curated backbone of VIRION (which includes non-viral pathogens) 
- the [insectDisease](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/insectDisease) R interface to the Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens.
