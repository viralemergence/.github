🦠 We're an NSF-funded collaboration working to predict viral ecology, evolution, and emergence. Our research often uses network science and machine learning to analyze and predict complex systems, especially host-virus networks. 

💻 Read more on our [website](https://www.viralemergence.org/), where you can also download all of our [publications](https://www.viralemergence.org/work) as PDFs (even if they're paywalled somewhere else).

### On our Github...

👩‍💻 Code for several ongoing and published projects is available here.

🔢 You can also access [datasets](https://www.viralemergence.org/data), like 
- [VIRION](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/virion), a database of host-virus interactions 
- [CLOVER](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/clover), the hand-curated backbone of VIRION (which includes non-viral pathogens) 
- [datacov](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/datacov), a database of nearly 100,000 samples tested for bat coronaviruses since 1996
- the [insectDisease](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/insectDisease) R interface to the Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens.

✍️ There's even templates for sharing your own data, like the [COMET data standard](https://www.github.com/viralemergence/comet-standard).
